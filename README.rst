Pælingar, sögur og önnur ritverk
================================

This is my personal project. One might call it a blog page, but my goals are
somewhat more ambitious than a mere blogpage might cover. Here I will not only
share my thoughts, but also my projects (like my studies) and my stories.

Goals
-----

This is not an exhaustive list, but it covers my most explicit goals...

  * To keep active a personal project that I can work on, and, at the same
    time  experiment, and learn, the latest trends in web development
  * To keep an open platform for my project so I can share them easily
  * To document and share the many stories I have badly- or not documented at
    all
  * To share my latest thoghts on shit
  * To present them in an awsome way to make me look more interesting then I
    am

Contents
--------

For now I'll be working on a few projecs including

  * **Stories** I've accumulated over the years like...

    - My hitchhiking trip trough America
    - My and Chantal`s *life in the bus*
    - My and Skúli`s *trip around the world*

  * **Thinkings**

    - Me trying to explain my philosophical views, like my disbelief in *free
      will*, my faith in *mathematics* in explaining the world, my many
      layman speculation in *astronomy*, *cosmology*, *physics* and stuff, and
      many more of my attemts to try to sound wise.

  * **Other writings** that I won't be able to fit into the previous
    categories, such as...

      - My masters project
      - scenes on how I've been doing this all (i.e. tutorials)
